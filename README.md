# SoundBro: Music Exam Scheduling Software

SoundBro is a web application designed to automate and streamline the process of scheduling music grade examinations in my school. This project was developed as an A-Level Computer Science Programming Project, and received 69/70 marks.

## The Problem

Manually creating music exam schedules is a tedious and complex task. Organizers must juggle strict exam board regulations, accompanist availability, and student details. This process is often inefficient, prone to errors, and stressful for everyone involved.


## The Solution

This project provides a computational solution that automates the scheduling process. By processing student entries and accompanist availability, **SoundBro generates an optimised and valid exam timetable in minutes**, ensuring all parties are satisfied. This reduces the administrative burden on organisers and provides clear, timely information to students, teachers, and accompanists.


## Key Features

* **Automated Scheduling**: A custom algorithm that generates a valid schedule adhering to all Trinity College London (TCL) regulations for breaks, session lengths, and exam timings.
* **Efficient Timetabling**: Optimises the schedule to group an accompanist's exams together while simultaneously adhering to their availability.
* **User Account System**: Secure login and registration for all user roles (organiser, student, music teacher, accompanist).
* **Personalized Dashboards**: After a schedule is published, users can log in to view only the time slots relevant to them.
* **Web-Based Interface**: Built as a web application for easy accessibility without requiring software installation.
